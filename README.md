# Let's Meet

## Description
Have you ever struggled with finding the best time to meet with your friends? Been flaked or have flaked on friends at the last minute? Let's Meet is a web application that is designed to help users easily coordinate and plan out events. 
Let's Meet aims to allow users to create, accept, and schedule public events. The beauty behind our design is that a user can define roles and a budget for each event so that each event is organized without added stress to the meeting planner. 

### Minimal Viable Product

## History
We wanted to develop an app that would not only make our lives much more convenient, but also increase our exposure to new libraries and technologies, which ultimately led us to decide on an application that relies on communication among users. We were inspired by apps such as Doodle and when2meet, but we felt like they could be improved upon. So, we decided to implement new features of our own that would make our app stand out and be more attractive to potential users.
